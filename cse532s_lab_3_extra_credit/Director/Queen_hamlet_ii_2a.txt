29 Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you, 
30 And sure I am two men there are not living 
31 To whom he more adheres. If it will please you 
32 To show us so much gentry and good-will 
33 As to expend your time with us awhile, 
34 For the supply and profit of our hope, 
35 Your visitation shall receive such thanks 
36 As fits a king's remembrance.
65 Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz: 
67 And I beseech you instantly to visit 
69 My too-much-changed son.--Go, some of you, 
70 And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
79 Ay, amen!
